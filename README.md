Introduction
</h1>

Charitable organizations play a vital role in addressing social challenges, and their success often depends on understanding donor behavior to design effective marketing strategies. This project aims to analyze the behavioral patterns of charity members to provide data-driven insights for targeted campaigns. By leveraging data science tools, we can help the charity group improve their engagement strategies, enhance donor retention, and attract new benefactors.
